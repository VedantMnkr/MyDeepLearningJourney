##Week 4
 
 Till now we were looking up to shallow neural networks, but this week was focused on deep L-layer neural networks where the "L" represents the number of layers.
 It gave a little more in depth knowledge of how to implement more than 1 hidden layer and how to debug a nerual network is to get your matrix dimension correct.
 
 Also more on forward and backdward propogation and clarification about parameters and hyperparmeters.
