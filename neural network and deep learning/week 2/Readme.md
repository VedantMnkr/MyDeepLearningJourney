### Week 2 

It was focused on getting started with basics of machine learning that are required in deep learning too like cost function , gradient descent and all.
This week i did a programming assignment on developing a logistic regression model with an apporach of a neural network where we treated the diffrent phases as layers

I will update more when it comes in my mind.
